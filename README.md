# Simple-5-pages-HTML-website
This is very simple html based website created by me, Abdalla Ahmed, in less than 2 hours as an application for an online html course. Some css codes are used to style the site, but their use was kept to a minimum. The site is dedicated to the greatest science-fiction movie I had ever seen, The Matrix (1999). The website includes the use of divs, tables, images, lists, paragraphs, hyperlinks, and also styling using some css codes.
